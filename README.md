# GraphQL Starter (WIP)

### GraphQL Server Starter using Apollo Server.

* This is **Work In Progress**, the are some errors to be fixed

The starter simulates a backend server for a blog. You have authors, posts and comments all tied together, this allows us to go in depth with our GraphQL Queries.

### Prerequisites:

You will need MongoDB working on port `27017` (default port, if you have MongoDB installed globably just run `mongod`)

And install the project dependecies

```javascript
npm install
```
Start the project
```javascript
npm start
```
You can check the GraphQL Playground at `http://localhost:4000`
